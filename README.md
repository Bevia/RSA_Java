### RSA General Theory

RSA encryption is a widely-used method for securing data, ensuring privacy, 
and authenticating communications in the digital world. Named after its inventors, 
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, 
meaning it uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

#### In simple terms, RSA works as follows:

1. **Key Generation**: Two large prime numbers are chosen and multiplied together to form a modulus. This modulus, along with an exponent, forms the public key, while a related exponent is kept secret as the private key.

2. **Encryption**: When someone wants to send a secure message, they use the recipient's public key to convert the message into an unreadable format.

3. **Decryption**: The recipient then uses their private key to convert the unreadable message back into its original form.

This process ensures that only the intended recipient, who possesses the private key, 
can read the message, providing a high level of security. 
RSA encryption is fundamental to many modern security protocols, including SSL/TLS for secure web browsing and PGP for encrypted emails.
