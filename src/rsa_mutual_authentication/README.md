Mutual authentication and key exchange protocols, is where both parties in a communication verify each other's identities and establish trust. In public key infrastructure, this can be facilitated through mechanisms like digital signatures, where each party signs certain data to prove their identity to the other.

Here’s how it could work in the context of securely storing a sender's public key signed by the recipient’s private key:

### Steps to Securely Store a Sender's Public Key

1. **Sender Sends Public Key:**
    - The sender generates a public-private key pair.
    - The sender sends their public key to the recipient.

   The error RSA_sign: digest too big for rsa key suggests that the data you are trying to sign is too large for the RSA key size.
   RSA is typically used to sign a hash of the data, not the raw data itself, because the raw data might be too large.
   To solve this, you should hash the data first (using SHA-256 in this case) and then sign the hash.

2. **Recipient Signs Sender’s Public Key:**
    - The recipient verifies the sender's identity through an out-of-band method or prior trust establishment.
    - The recipient signs the sender’s public key with their own private key to create a signed public key.

3. **Secure Storage:**
    - The recipient securely stores the signed public key.
    - This storage ensures that the recipient can later verify that the public key they received is indeed the sender's and hasn't been tampered with.

4. **Verification Later:**
    - When the recipient needs to use the sender's public key, they can verify the signature on the stored public key using their own public key.
    - This ensures that the public key is the same as the one initially received and verified.

### Advantages

- **Integrity and Authenticity:**
    - The signed public key guarantees that the public key has not been altered since it was signed.
    - Ensures the public key's authenticity, verifying it came from the expected sender.

- **Trust Establishment:**
    - Both parties establish mutual trust through the signing and verification process.
    - Reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
